# TankGame
Tank game written in C language.

Highlights:
- Code comments (short & concise)
- Function header comments (short & concise)
- Modularization of the code (Short functions), 40-60 max lines of code.
- Line width (100 char max)
- Low cyclomatic complexity of the code
- No multiple returns, global variables.
- No break, continue statements inside loops (switch statements are allowed).
- No code duplication.
- Header file usage (logical grouping of functions into headers)
- Static functions (all methods not listed in headers must be static)
- Meaningful variable names and function names (the name itself indicates what it does without comments)
- Input validation according to the assignment spec.
- Valgrind (0 memory leaks) during gameplay & initial stage of validating input
- Zero crashes (should meet all assignment spec requirements.)
- Makefile dependencies are correctly listed (non-dependant headers not included)
- Performance improvement (Refer PERF comment) - Optional
